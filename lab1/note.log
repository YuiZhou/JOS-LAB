# debuginfo_eip type
 Firstly, I do not know what type parameter to use in the inc/stab.h.
  "Solution"
	There is a line "JOS uses the N_SO, N_SOL, N_FUN and N_SLINE types". Actually, I have no idea of the N_SO and N_SOL, but the N_SLINE is the only one to find a line number.

# debuginfo_eip offset
 I have already pass the grade script, but there are still a bug. I do not know which parameter is tell me the offset of the instruction call a function. So I use '0' represent.
