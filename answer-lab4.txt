Question1. In the mpentry.S, the MPBOOTPHYS is used to calculate absolute addresses of its symbols. However in the boot.S, the absolute address can be viewed according the link address because there is a map bewteen the low address and high address. When booting the APS, the cr0 is set and the APS can not direct access the  physical address.

Question2. When CPUA pushes some value to the sharing stack and then is interrupted, CPU B gets the lock and starts running its threads, it pushed values in the stack, too. The value in the stack pushed by CPU A will not be used once the control is return to CPU A.

Question3. In lab3, we mapped it in a fixed address in the kernel.

Question4. When a cpu needs switching an environment, it invokes an system call which we have done in lab3. For invoking an system call, the trapentry.S push a trapFrame into the stack before it call trap(). It is where that the environment saves the old registers.
